# Citrics - A City Metrics app

A city metrics collation app to help find the perfect city for you!

You can find the deployed project at [Citrics](https://citrics.netlify.app/).

### Key Features

- View useful metrics, including weather patterns, housing prices, job market, demographics, and more!
- Currently features information on the `100` largest US cities, with more to come
- Select up to three cities to compare side-by-side
- Dig into detailed historical information, trends, and future predictions
- Glance at future predeictions for specific statistics
- Complete an Advanced Search to filter cities with specific requirements


### ðŸ”® Future Feature Ideas

- Provide a more complete list/suggestions for an unsuccessful search
- Determine additional types of data can be shown e.g.: Demographics (age, religion, etc), access to activities (hiking trails, bars, restaurants, etc)
- After looking at a city, I can click on a 'See cities similar to this' feature
- User can search for a city by Zip code
- Styling: model the home page to be more useful. Instead of side bar and 'Get Started' button, incorporate the search bar like this [similar app](https://www.areavibes.com/)

### Front end deployed to `Netlify`

### [Backend](https://b-ds.citrics.dev) built using FastAPI:

Our Data Science team collated a variety of metrics and created predictive models. See [their repo](https://github.com/labs26-citrics/Labs26-Citrics-DS-TeamB) for more information

# APIs

## Google Places API

We used the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/photos) to dynamically retrieve the most appropriate cover images for each city in our database.

To use this API, you must provide a valid API key in the environment variable `REACT_APP_PLACES_API_KEY`, either using a `.env` file or in the configuration of your deployment.

You can find instructions on getting an API key in [this Medium article](https://codeburst.io/adding-city-images-to-your-react-app-14c937df2db2).

## Open Weather API

We used the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve and display the current weather for each city in our database.

To use this API, you must provide a valid API key in the environment variable `REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_API`, either using a `.env` file or in the configuration of your deployment.

You can find instructions on getting an API key in [this article](https://openweathermap.org/appid).

## Backend APIs
See [Backend Documentation](https://github.com/labs26-citrics/Labs26-Citrics-DS-TeamB) for more information on the APIs used by our Data Science team.
